## 🚀 Project Progress: Sprint 4 
1. Design and Planning (Completed) We started the process by defining the project architecture and user flows.

Wireframing: I sketched wireframes for the Landing Page and Dashboard to clarify exactly how the UI would look.

Task Planning: We organized the entire process and sprint distribution using Miro.

2. Frontend Development - MVP (Completed) We brought the planned design to life using React and Material-UI.

Public Interface: A modern Landing Page, Solutions, and Support pages have been created.

Authentication: Login and Register pages are complete, including form validation and role-based routing (Admin vs. Citizen).

Admin Dashboard: A responsive management panel skeleton featuring a Sidebar and Topbar has been established.

Gateway Management: Modules for listing devices, filtering (Active/Inactive/Battery), and adding new devices are finished.

3. Backend & Integration (Completed)

The Node.js/Express infrastructure was set up, and API connections with the Frontend were established via Axios.

A "Mock Fallback" structure was implemented for data fetching operations, ensuring the system remains functional under all conditions.

🚧 What's Next?
Currently, the system's management, listing, and user authentication modules are fully ready.

One Major Task Remaining: Map Visualization (Live Map) integration.

In the next step, we will complete the visualization aspect of the project by pinning gateway devices on a map using Leaflet/Mapbox
## ⚙️ Installation & Run Instructions

This project utilizes a **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) structure. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application locally.


## 🚀 Recent Updates: Sprint 4 (Advanced Features & Integration)
<img width="858" height="863" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a3c8dc6-a5ca-447f-98f9-1db5f4a7882a" />

We have significantly expanded the capabilities of the platform, focusing on the **Citizen Interface** and **Real-time Visualization** for Admins.

### 🗺️ 1. Admin Live Map Integration
The Admin Dashboard now features a dynamic map interface powered by **Leaflet**.
- **Visualizes all active gateways** on a geographical map using real-time coordinates.
- Provides instant situational awareness for disaster response coordinators.
- *Status:* Implementation completed & merged to main.

### 🏠 2. Citizen Dashboard & Household Profiling
A dedicated interface for citizens has been developed to enhance rescue prioritization.
- **Device Monitoring:** Users can track the battery and signal status of their own gateways.
- **Household Profiling (Critical Feature):** Users can input critical household data (Number of Children, Elderly, Medical Conditions) during device registration.
- **Purpose:** This data allows the system to calculate a **"Priority Score"** for each household, helping rescue teams triage effectively during an earthquake.

## 🎯 MVP Scope & Features

This project implements the core user flows for both Administrators and Citizens:

### 1. Public Landing Page
- Modern introduction to the Hayat Ağı ecosystem.
- Overview of hardware components (ESP32, LoRa) and mobile application solutions.

### 2. Authentication System (RBAC)
- **Secure Login/Register:** Role-based access control distinguishing between **Admins** and **Citizens**.
- **Form Validation:** Real-time feedback and error handling for user inputs.

### 3. Admin Dashboard (Command Center)
- **Gateway Management:**
  - **Listing:** View all gateways with advanced filtering (Status, Battery Level, Search).
  - **CRUD Operations:** Add new devices and remove faulty ones.
- **Live Map:** Visualizing device locations and network topology.

### 4. Citizen Panel
- **Personal Dashboard:** Monitoring own gateway status.
- **Emergency Profile:** Managing critical contact info and household risk assessment data.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v16 or higher)
* MongoDB (Local instance or Atlas URI)

---

### 1. Backend Setup (Server)
The backend service handles API requests and database connections.

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install server dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` root directory and add your configuration (see the *.env Example* section below).
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    > *Server will run on: `http://localhost:5000`*

---

### 2. Frontend Setup (Client)
The React application (built with Vite) serves the user interface.

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd hayat-agi-frontend
    ```
2.  Install client dependencies (Required for Material UI & Axios):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    > *Application will open at: `http://localhost:5173`*
